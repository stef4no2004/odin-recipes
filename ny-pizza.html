        <li>2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Olive oil for dough</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sauce & Assembly</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3.5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>28oz can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced in half, leaving the root attached </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar </li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons dried oregano </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1.5 lbs low moisture mozzarella, coarse grated </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol><p>Pizza Dough</p>
    <li><p>In a container, add water, heat up to 95F, whisk in yeast and let it sit for 5 min. To a large bowl, add flour, salt, and sugar; mix that until incorporated.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add your water with yeast to your flour and mix by hand until you get a relatively smooth dough, about 4 min. Next, shape your dough into a ball, generously grease a large bowl with olive oil, and place your dough; cover with greased plastic wrap and rise in the fridge overnight.</p></li>
    <li><p>Punch down your dough, place it onto a lightly floured work surface, divide it into 300 grams pieces, roll each piece into a light ball, and put it into a lightly floured proofing box or a baking sheet (leaving room in between each other). Cover with a lid or greased plastic wrap and let it proof for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or until doubled in size.</p></li> 
    </ol>
    <ol><p>Sauce & Assembly</p>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to max temperature for one hour before baking, or set up your pizza oven to 650F.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil, garlic, butter, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic turns into a light golden brown. </li>
        <li>Then add pepper flakes and saute for 20 seconds, followed by tomatoes, sugar, oregano, and thyme. Stir together, season with salt, add onion, bring it to a simmer, and cook that down, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the onion, adjust the salt levels and cool down completely. </li>
        <li>Assembly.- Place one of your dough rounds on a lightly floured work surface and generously flour your dough. Next, begin punching out a very thin perimeter in the dough, trip the dough over your fists, and shimmer around the entire perimeter of the dough, lightly stretching it as you go until you get a pizza round, about 2 -3 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Lay it back down, place a couple of tablespoons of your sauce in the center, and spread it around in a circular motion, leaving a slight edge. </li>
        <li>Top with a generous amount of freshly grated mozzarella and place in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes or in a pizza oven for 2 to 4 minutes. Repeat with the rest of your dough. </li>
    </ol>
